A website project using Blazor WASM, integrated with Google APIs

This project is still work in progress. 
The goal is to have my own website using Blazor WASM where I can keep track of my favourite pieces of entertainment like books, shows, movies or games.

Planned initial features:
- Allow adding books to the website and rank them according to my liking
- All book details are loaded from external API (Google Books API), only my personal rating and comments are stored locally
- Allow guests to send me suggestions for new books to read (still considering storage solution)

After initial features I want to expand them for movies (probably using imdb API) and games (no specific API yet)
